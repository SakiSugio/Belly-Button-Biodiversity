# Plotly Challenge - Belly Button Biodiversity

https://sakisugio.github.io/Plotly-challenge/Belly-Button-Biodiversity/

## Introduction
Build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset], which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

___
1. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
* Use the JavaScript filter() method
* USe slice() to select the top 10 OTUs
* Manipulate charts through dropdown events 
* Use map() to create Plotly chart

2. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
* Use Plotly's layout object to customize the appearance of their charts
* Annotate chart with labels, text, and hover text
