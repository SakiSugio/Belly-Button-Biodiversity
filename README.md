# Plotly Challenge - Belly Button Biodiversity

https://sakisugio.github.io/Plotly-challenge/Belly-Button-Biodiversity/

## Introduction
Build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset], which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Steps
1. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

2. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
